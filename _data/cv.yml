        - Research with Dr. Brian Kobilka
        - title: Major research accomplishments
          contents: 
            - Part of a team that obtained a molecular structure of the Neurotensin type 1 receptor (NTSR1) in complex with &#946;-arrestin 1 by single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). 
            - Established a mechanistic basis for phosphoinositide regulation of &#946;-arrestin function. 
            - Used single-molecule FRET spectroscopy (smFRET) to investigate the mechanism of &#946;-arrestin activation, and GPCR-&#946;-arrestin complex dynamics.
