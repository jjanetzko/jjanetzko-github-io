Hi, I'm a basic science instructor in [the Department of Molecular & Cellular Physiology](https://med.stanford.edu/mcp.html) at Stanford University. I work in the lab of [Dr. Brian Kobilka](https://med.stanford.edu/kobilkalab) where I use biochemical and biophysical methods to study how G protein-coupled receptors function, and specifically how they are desensitized and regulated in cells. I first joined Dr. Kobilka's lab as a postdoctoral scholar in September 2017; my research has been supported by a Stanford School of Medicine Dean's Postdoctoral Fellowship, a [Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation Fellowship]() and most recently, a K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award from [the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)](https://www.nigms.nih.gov/). As a K99 fellow I am co-mentored by [Dr. Mark von Zastrow](http://www.vzlab.org/) at the University of California San Francisco, an expert in GPCR cell biology and trafficking. In December 2022 I was appointed as an instructor in Molecular & Cellular Physiology.

Outside the lab, I am deeply involved with the local cycling community. I train and race competitvely with [Alto Velo](https://www.altovelo.org/) on the [Northern California/Nevada cycling scene](https://ncnca.org/). Outside of my own racing, I am passionate about rider education and development. I have been a coach for the [Stanford University cycling team](https://cycling.stanford.edu/)since 2020, leading skills clinics and teaching riders about training, nutrition and racing. I was elected to serve on the Alto Velo Board of Directors in 2022, and recently re-elected for 2023. You can follow some of my adventures on two wheels [on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/thejohnnler/).
