	abstract = {A practical method for the chemo- and diastereoselective allylation of $\alpha$,$\beta$-epoxy ketones has been developed by using the convenient air and moisture stable reagent potassium allyltrifluoroborate. Indium metal was found to promote addition in stoichiometric or catalytic amounts, to afford $\alpha$,$\beta$-epoxyhomoallylic tertiary alcohols in high yields and diastereoselectivities, without competing ring-scission of the epoxide.},
